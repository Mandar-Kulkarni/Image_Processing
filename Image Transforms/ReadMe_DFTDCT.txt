This code executes simple DFT and DCT trasforms on Images in C++.

Steps for running the program:
1. Create a new empty project in visual studio.
2. Link OpenCV libraries to the project.
3. Copy the image "zebras.jpg" to the same folder as the code. 
4. Add the DFT_DCT.cpp file in this folder to the project.
5. Run the code.
6. 3 output windows will be displayed with window name "Original Output", "Inverse DFT" and "Inverse DCT".
7. The output of Inverse DFT and Inverse DCT will also be saved in the parent folder.
7. Press Escape to close the windows.
